Student Developed Citation and Format Style

We desire to create an citation and formating platform that has more flexability than APA and MLA, while being sensible and understandable for students and professors. SODA documentation shall be provided for free. No books to purchase, no collections of external third party links to provide to attemtp to explain simple citation efforts. This is a work in progress.
